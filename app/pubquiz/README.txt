todo:

Title is now "Pubquiz" and will become "Pubquiz - <screenname>".
Add waiting screen (and home tab) with prefilled/quizmaster set message.
Number 87 on quiz pages is a mistake and should not be there.
Grading: One press. 1 point (all good), second press 0.5 points (half good), third return to 0 points.
Submit button (quiz=grading). For now leave it. But think about quizmaster decides time of submit.
If quizmaster decides about submit then we could use a snackbar for quizmaster messages.
Red+green icons become arrows left+right
Arrows (and optionally submit button) will be at fixed location above tabbar
Home Icon -> Quiz Icon + text
Final highscores :
    Remove 'back to quiz' and 'close quiz' buttons
    wishlist:
        rank 3, 2, 1 and only then the rest
Can the user always see the scores or only when the quizmaster allows it.
For now no playerslist
For now no team icon
Leave Quiz add confirmation dialog
During grading a rood kruis, (bijv.) yin/yan symbol, geen checkbox ipv checkbox
Suggestion: add a training-round
